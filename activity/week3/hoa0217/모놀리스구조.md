## 테스트 스크립트

load-test를 진행했습니다.

```js
import http from 'k6/http';
import {sleep} from 'k6';

export const options = {
  // Key configurations for avg load test in this section
  stages: [{duration: '1m', target: 100}, // traffic ramp-up from 1 to 50 users over 1 minutes.
    {duration: '5m', target: 100}, // stay at 100 users for 5 minutes
    {duration: '1m', target: 0}, // ramp-down to 0 users
  ],
};

export default () => {
  const urlRes = http.get('http://localhost:8080/api/v1/order/1');
  sleep(1);
  // MORE STEPS
  // Here you can have more steps or complex script
  // Step1
  // Step2
  // etc.
};
```

실행 명령어
```shell
k6 run --out influxdb=http://localhost:8086/k6 load-test.js
```

## 단순 조회
단순 조회는 순차적으로 order, product, delivery, refund를 조회합니다.
order product까지 포함하면 총 5개의 테이블을 순차적으로 조회하게 됩니다.

아래와 같은 쿼리가 연속적으로 나갑니다.

```sql
Hibernate: 
    select
        order0_.id as id1_2_0_,
        order0_.created_at as created_2_2_0_,
        order0_.updated_at as updated_3_2_0_,
        order0_.order_number as order_nu4_2_0_,
        order0_.order_status as order_st5_2_0_ 
    from
        orders order0_ 
    where
        order0_.id=?

        delivery0_.created_at as created_2_0_,
        delivery0_.updated_at as updated_3_0_,
        delivery0_.address as address4_0_,
        delivery0_.delivery_momo as delivery5_0_,
        delivery0_.mobile as mobile6_0_,
        delivery0_.order_id as order_id7_0_,
        delivery0_.recipient_name as recipien8_0_,
        delivery0_.store_password as store_pa9_0_,
        delivery0_.zip_code as zip_cod10_0_ 
    from

    from
        refunds refund0_ 
    where
        refund0_.order_id=?
```

성능테스트 결과는 아래와 같습니다.

## CompletableFuture를 활용한 병렬 처리

위에서는 테이블을 순차적으로 조회했다면 여기서는 동시에 여러스레드가 테이블에 접근하여 조회해옵니다.

CompletableFuture를 사용하면 실행순서는 보장할 수 없지만 조금 더 빠른 성능을 보일거라 예상했습니다.

```shell
Hibernate: 
    select
        order0_.id as id1_2_0_,
        order0_.created_at as created_2_2_0_,
        order0_.updated_at as updated_3_2_0_,
        order0_.order_number as order_nu4_2_0_,
        order0_.order_status as order_st5_2_0_ 
    from
        orders order0_ 
    where
        order0_.id=?
Hibernate: 
    select
        orderprodu0_.id as id1_1_,
        orderprodu0_.created_at as created_2_1_,
        orderprodu0_.updated_at as updated_3_1_,
        orderprodu0_.order_id as order_id4_1_,
        orderprodu0_.product_id as product_5_1_ 
    from
        order_products orderprodu0_ 
    where
        orderprodu0_.order_id=?
Hibernate: 
    select
        refund0_.id as id1_5_,
        refund0_.created_at as created_2_5_,
        refund0_.updated_at as updated_3_5_,
        refund0_.order_id as order_id4_5_,
        refund0_.refund_amount as refund_a5_5_,
        refund0_.refund_method_name as refund_m6_5_,
        refund0_.refund_status as refund_s7_5_ 
    from
        refunds refund0_ 
    where
        refund0_.order_id=?
Hibernate: 
    select
        delivery0_.id as id1_0_,
        delivery0_.created_at as created_2_0_,
        delivery0_.updated_at as updated_3_0_,
        delivery0_.address as address4_0_,
        delivery0_.delivery_momo as delivery5_0_,
        delivery0_.mobile as mobile6_0_,
        delivery0_.order_id as order_id7_0_,
        delivery0_.recipient_name as recipien8_0_,
        delivery0_.store_password as store_pa9_0_,
        delivery0_.zip_code as zip_cod10_0_ 
    from
        deliverys delivery0_ 
    where
        delivery0_.order_id=?
Hibernate: 
    select
        product0_.id as id1_4_0_,
        product0_.created_at as created_2_4_0_,
        product0_.updated_at as updated_3_4_0_,
        product0_.bundle_name as bundle_n4_4_0_,
        product0_.bundle_quantity as bundle_q5_4_0_,
        product0_.description as descript6_4_0_,
        product0_.price as price7_4_0_,
        product0_.product_name as product_8_4_0_ 
    from
        products product0_ 
    where
        product0_.id=?
Hibernate: 
    select
        product0_.id as id1_4_0_,
        product0_.created_at as created_2_4_0_,
        product0_.updated_at as updated_3_4_0_,
        product0_.bundle_name as bundle_n4_4_0_,
        product0_.bundle_quantity as bundle_q5_4_0_,
        product0_.description as descript6_4_0_,
        product0_.price as price7_4_0_,
        product0_.product_name as product_8_4_0_ 
    from
        products product0_ 
    where
        product0_.id=?
```

하지만 결과는 단순 조회랑 크게 차이가 없었습니다.. 오히려 조금 더 느려졌습니다.

이제 인덱스를 적용해보겠습니다. 모든테이블은 orderId를 where 조건으로 조회되므로 orderId로 인덱스를 생성해주었습니다.

```sql
-- Deliverys 테이블에 인덱스 추가
CREATE INDEX idx_deliverys_order_id ON deliverys(order_id);

-- Order_products 테이블에 인덱스 추가
CREATE INDEX idx_order_products_order_id ON order_products(order_id);

-- Payments 테이블에 인덱스 추가
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_order_id ON payments(order_id);

-- Refunds 테이블에 인덱스 추가
CREATE INDEX idx_refunds_order_id ON refunds(order_id);
```

## 단순 조회 + orderId Index

평균 2.72ms Latency에서 2.63ms로 조금 단축된것을 볼 수 있습니다.

## CompletableFuture를 활용한 병렬 처리 + orderId Index

여기서 조금 놀랐습니다. 인덱스 적용 전에는 평균 2.76ms Latency였는데 병렬처리를 수행하니 거의 1ms가 빨라졌습니다.

## 로컬 캐싱(Ehcache)

> 저는 Ehcache를 적용하여 아래와 같이 캐싱을 적용해주었습니다.   
> 참고: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-boot-ehcache

```java
@Cacheable(value = "orderCache", key = "#orderId")
public OrderDetailResponse findOrderDetail(Long orderId) {
    OrderResponse order = findOrder(orderId);
    List<ProductResponse> products = findProducts(orderId);
    DeliveryResponse delivery = findDelivery(orderId);
    RefundResponse refund = findRefund(orderId);

    return new OrderDetailResponse(
            order,
            products,
            delivery,
            refund
    );
}
```

캐싱을 수행하면, DB와의 Connection은 한번만 일어나고 그뒤로는 캐시에서 데이터를 가져오기때문에 훨씬빨라질것이라 생각했습니다.

단순히 DB에서 순차적으로 조회하는것보다는 빨랐지만, 병렬로 데이터를 가져오는 처리보다는 훨씬 느렸습니다.

이를 통해 무조건 캐싱하는것이 빠를거라는 생각은 잘못된생각이었으며 직접 테스트해보고 적용해야함을 느꼈습니다.
